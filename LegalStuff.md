I created this page to contain notes about Tetris legal stuff so we don't infringe, etc.


# Details #

USPTO says that Tetris is owned by:
```

And they have a prosecution history.

## Music ##
I checked with a lot of the music used and because most of it is old russian classical folk music, it in the public domain and shouldn't be a problem.

The main theme song, however, has some trademark protection:

`Description of Mark: The mark is a sound. The mark consists of an electronic sine wave playing a tune based on a Russian folk song named Korobeiniki. The notes played are E (quarter note), B (eighth note), C (eighth note), D (quarter note), C (eighth note), B (eighth note), A (quarter note), A (eighth note), C (eighth note), E (quarter note), D (eighth note), C (eighth note), B (three-quarter note), C (eighth note), D (quarter note), E (quarter note), C (quarter note), A (quarter note), A (half note), quarter rest, D (quarter note), F (eighth note), A (eighth note), A (eighth note), G (eighth note), F (eighth note), E (three quarter note), C (eighth note), E (quarter note), D (eighth note), C (eighth note), B (quarter note), B (eighth note), C (eighth note), D (quarter note), E (quarter note), C (quarter note), A (quarter note), A (half note).`

I think would only infringe if we had the song "electronic sine wave"ish, but I bet we could get away with a heavy metal version.

What do you guys think?
